### Education

BSc (Trent Univeristy)

### About

Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cervids and has been found in many surrounding states and provinces to Ontario. My research focuses on quantifying white-tailed deer habitat selection, seasonal movement patterns, space use and contact patterns through the use of radio proximity collars. This information will be used to inform the management of CWD, if it is ever found inside of Ontarioâ€™s borders. Prior to my MSc candidacy, I received my BSc at Trent University in Biology and completed a 3 year Fish and Wildlife program at Fleming College. This research initiative is co-supervised with Dr. [Aaron Shafer](http://www.aaronshafer.ca/).
