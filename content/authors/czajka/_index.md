My research interests include the impacts of DNA methylation on phenotypes such as aging and disease. Currently, Iâ€™m working on building species-specific epigenetic clocks for black bear, white-tailed deer and mountain goat using large-scale methylation arrays. The goal of this work is to increase the understanding of age structures in natural populations, which is fundamental to wildlife management. Prior to starting graduate studies, I received my BSc in Biology at Queens University. Co-supervised with [Dr. Aaron Shafer](http://www.aaronshafer.ca/).
