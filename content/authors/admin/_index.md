Welcome to my research group, based at Trent University. We study the variety of ways in which humans impact wildlife. Humans have become the dominant driver of change to ecological systems, and we seek to understand how such change impacts individual behavior and population dynamics. Most of our work is focused on understanding how animals move through and use space in human-modified landscapes, but our [research](research/) spans a wide range of fields from animal behavior, to statistical ecology and genomics. We aim to make this work applied in nature, but grounded in ecological and evolutionary theory. Check out [who we are](people/) and [what we do](research/). For interested students or post-docs, take a look at opportunities to [join the lab](opps/).
