Lauren is examining how polar bear sub-populations in Southern Hudson Bay and James Bay are implicated by a reduction in sea ice in relation to climate change. Utilizing collar telemetry data, she is assessing the population distribution, migratory movements, and denning habitat in relation to human settlements. In addition, she is employing a quantitative fatty acid signature analysis to assess the dietary habits, body condition, and foraging success of the bears. The results of her research will be beneficial to explore how polar bear diets and use of space are implicated by changes to northern environments. Co-supervised with [Dr. Greg Thiemann] (https://biology.gradstudies.yorku.ca/faculty/g-thiemann/) at York University.
