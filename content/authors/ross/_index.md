### About

Tyler is studying the movements and habitat selection of polar bears in Southern Hudson Bay and James Bay. Using location data collected from GPS-collared bears, he is examining the terrestrial and on-ice movement of polar bears in relation to environmental conditions, including snow and sea-ice characteristics. He is also looking at the distribution of polar bear denning habitat along the coast of northern Ontario, and exploring how changing sea-ice conditions may be impacting polar bear diets and reproduction. Co-supervised with[Dr. Greg Thiemann](https://biology.gradstudies.yorku.ca/faculty/g-thiemann/) at York University.
